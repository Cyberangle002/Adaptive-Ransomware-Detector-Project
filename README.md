# Adaptive-Ransomware-Detector-Project
The Adaptive Ransomware Detector is an advanced cybersecurity tool designed to identify and mitigate ransomware threats in real time. Leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, this system monitors file activity and system behavior to detect and respond to potential ransomware attacks effectively.

## Key Features
Behavioral Analysis: Monitors system activities and file operations to identify abnormal patterns indicative of ransomware.
Machine Learning Integration: Employs machine learning algorithms trained on a dataset of known ransomware and benign activities for accurate classification.
Real-Time Detection: Capable of detecting ransomware during its encryption process to minimize damage.
Adaptive Learning: Continuously updates its detection models to adapt to emerging ransomware variants.
Automated Response System:
Isolates infected systems to prevent lateral spread.
Automatically kills malicious processes upon detection.
User-Friendly Dashboard: Provides clear alerts, logs, and reports for administrators to review.

## Tools and Technologies Used
Operating System: Kali Linux
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
TensorFlow/PyTorch for machine learning models
Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and classification
OS and sys libraries for system monitoring
Dataset: Ransomware and normal activity logs for model training
Platform: Linux-based environment for robust performance and security


## Applications
Enterprise Security: Safeguards sensitive corporate data by identifying and neutralizing ransomware.
Personal Data Protection: Offers individuals a reliable tool to protect their systems from ransomware attacks.
Cybersecurity Research: Serves as a foundation for exploring adaptive threat detection mechanisms.


## Future Enhancements
Expanding the dataset to include more ransomware families for improved accuracy.
Implementing cross-platform support for Windows and Mac systems.
Integrating with cloud storage services for enhanced protection.
